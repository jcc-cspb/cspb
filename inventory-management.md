# Inventory Management Procedure:

### 2.1. Digital Inventory System:
- **Tool Selection**: Choose a user-friendly, scalable, and secure digital inventory tool.
- **Procedure**:
    1. Evaluate available inventory management software based on ease of use, scalability, and security features.
    2. Purchase and deploy the chosen tool in the computer lab.
    3. Train staff and relevant personnel on its usage.
    4. Regularly update the software to ensure smooth functionality.

### 2.2. Asset Tagging:
- **Tagging Supplies**: Use durable and tamper-proof tags.
- **Procedure**:
    1. Assign a unique ID to every piece of hardware.
    2. Enter the details of each item, including the ID, into the digital inventory system.
    3. Physically affix the tag to the hardware, ensuring visibility and security.
    4. Periodically inspect tags for wear and replace as necessary.

### 2.3. Periodic Checks:
- **Frequency**: Conduct checks monthly or quarterly based on lab usage and scale.
- **Team Involved**: IT team and lab administrators.
- **Procedure**:
    1. Select a date and inform all stakeholders of the upcoming inventory check.
    2. Compare physical assets in the lab with records in the digital inventory system.
    3. Identify any discrepancies or missing items.
    4. Update the system based on the physical check, recording any changes made.
    5. If items are found missing or damaged, initiate inquiries or follow-up actions as required.

### 2.4. Software License Tracking:
- **Compliance**: Ensure all installed software is licensed.
- **Procedure**:
    1. Use the license management tool or section in the inventory system to track all software licenses.
    2. Document the number of licenses, start and expiry dates, and renewal conditions.
    3. Set alerts or reminders for impending license renewals.
    4. Conduct periodic checks to ensure installed software aligns with the number of licenses procured.

### 2.5. Reporting:
- **Frequency**: Generate reports semi-annually or as required.
- **Procedure**:
    1. Use the digital inventory system's reporting feature to generate inventory reports.
    2. Review reports for trends, such as frequent equipment damages or software license overuse.
    3. Share reports with relevant stakeholders for transparency and decision-making.

### 2.6. Inventory Updates:
- **Triggers**: Updates should occur after every procurement, disposal, or during periodic checks.
- **Procedure**:
    1. Whenever new items are procured, immediately add them to the inventory system.
    2. If items are disposed of or permanently removed from the lab, update the system to reflect this.
    3. During periodic checks, make necessary updates to ensure the system accurately reflects the physical inventory.

> Note: Effective inventory management is essential to ensure the longevity of lab assets, compliance with software licenses, and financial accountability. Regular reviews and training can further optimize the process.
